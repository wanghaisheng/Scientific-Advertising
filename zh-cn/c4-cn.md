# 第四章 邮件营销广告——经验和教训


广告人最严峻的考验是通过邮件销售产品。但如果想成功，必须过这一关。成本和结果是显而易见的。那些不靠谱的理论就像阳光下的雪花一样。广告是否赚钱，从回报中一眼就看得出来。数字是不会撒谎的，你可以很快了解某个广告的优缺点。

这给了从业人员极大的鼓舞。杜绝拍脑袋。每个失误都是显而易见的。在明白了自己主观判断十有八九是错的情况下，很快也就不再那么自负。

这时候人们意识到只有采用科学才能在广告行业取得成功。也明白了每浪费一分钱都增加了最终结果的成本。

广告主不再是那么好糊弄的，你必须效果又好成本又低。也只有这样才最终促使他将同样的原则和关键因素应用到所有的广告中去。

有个人一篇广告收费5美元。收效的话算起来广告成本是85美分。另外一个人给了一个自认为更好的广告，每个订单的成本是14.20美元。另外一个人的广告持续了2年，每个订单的成本降到了41美分。

考虑到这其中的差异，假设每年产生25万个订单。你就算得出花14.20美元的人，却没有任何回报，到底意味着什么。


Yet there are thousands of advertisers who do just that. They spend large sums on a guess. And they are doing what that man did—
paying for sales from 2 to 35 times what they need cost.

A study of mail order advertising reveals many things worth learning. It is a prime subject for study. In the first place, if
continued, you know that it pays. It is therefore good advertising as applied to that line.

The probability is that the ad has resulted from many traced comparisons. It is therefore the best advertising yet discovered for
that line.

Study those ads with respect. There is proved advertising, not theoretical. It will not deceive you. The lessons it teaches are
principles which wise men apply to all advertising.

Mail order advertising is always set in small type. It is usually set in smaller type than ordinary print. That economy of space is universal.
So it proves conclusively that larger type does not pay.

Remember that when you double your space by doubling the size of your type. The ad may still be profitable. But traced returns have
proved that you are paying a double price for sales.

In mail order advertising there is no waste of space. Every line is utilized. Borders are rarely used. Remember that when you are
tempted to leave valuable space unoccupied.

In mail order advertising there is no palaver. There is no boasting, save of super-service. There is no useless talk. There is no attempt at
entertainment. There is nothing to amuse.

Mail order advertising usually contains a coupon. That is there to get some action from the converts partly made. It is there to cut out as a
reminder of something the reader has decided to do.

Mail order advertisers know that readers forget. They are reading a magazine of interest. They may be absorbed in a story. A large
percentage of people who read an ad and decide to act will forget that decision in five minutes. The mail order advertiser knows that
waste by tests, and he does not propose to accept it. So he inserts that reminder to be cut out, and it turns up when the reader is ready to act.

In mail order advertising the pictures are always to the point. They are salesmen in themselves. They earn the space they occupy. The
size is gauged by their importance. The picture of a dress one is trying to sell may occupy much space. Less important things get
smaller spaces.

Pictures in ordinary advertising may teach little. They probably result from whims. But pictures in mail order advertising may form half the
cost of selling. And you may be sure that everything about them has been decided by many comparative tests.

Before you use useless pictures, merely to decorate or interest, look over some mail order ads. Mark what their verdict is.

A man advertised an incubator to be sold by mail. Type ads with right headlines brought excellent returns. But he conceived the idea
that a striking picture would increase those returns. So he increased his space 50 per cent to add a row of chickens in silhouette.

It did make a striking ad, but his cost per reply was increased by exactly 50 per cent. The new ad, costing one-half more for every
insertion, brought not one added sale.

The man learned that incubator buyers were practical people. They were looking for attractive offers, not for pictures.

Think of the countless untraced campaigns where a whim of that kind costs half the advertising money without a penny of return. And
it may go on year after year.

Mail order advertising tells a complete story if the purpose is to make an immediate sale. You see no limitations there on amount of copy.
The motto there is, "The more you tell the more you sell." And it has never failed to prove out so in any test we know.

Sometimes the advertiser uses small ads, sometimes large ads. None are too small to tell a reasonable story. But an ad twice larger brings
twice the returns. A four-times-larger ad brings four times the returns, and usually some in addition.

But this occurs only when the larger space is utilized as well as the small space. Set half-page copy in a page space and you double the
cost of returns. We have seen many a test prove that.

Look at an ad of the Mead Cycle Company—a typical mail order ad. These have been running for many years. The ads are unchanging.
Mr. Mead told the writer that not for $10,000 would he change a single word in his ads.

For many years he compared one ad with another. And the ads you see today are the final result of all those experiments. Note the
picture he uses, the headlines, the economy of space, the small type. Those ads are as near perfect for their purpose as an ad can be.

So with any other mail order ad which has long continued. Every feature, every word and picture teaches advertising at its best. You
may not like them. You may say they are unattractive, crowded, hard to read—anything you will. But the test of results has proved those
ads the best salesmen those lines have yet discovered. And they certainly pay.

Mail order advertising is the court of last resort. You may get the same instruction, if you will, by keying other ads. But mail order ads
are models. They are selling goods profitably in a difficult way. It is far harder to get mail orders than to send buyers to the stores. It is hard to sell goods which can't be seen. Ads which do that are
excellent examples of what advertising should be.

We cannot often follow all the principles of mail order advertising, though we know we should. The advertiser forces a compromise. Perhaps pride in our ads has an influence. But every departure from those principles adds to our selling cost. Therefore it is always a
question of what we are willing to pay for our frivolities.

We can at least know what we pay. We can make keyed comparisons, one ad with another. Whenever we do we invariably find that the nearer we get to proved mail order copy the more
customers we get for our money.

This is another important chapter. Think it over. What real difference is there between inducing a customer to order by mail or order from
his dealer? Why should the methods of salesmanship differ?

They should not. When they do, it is for one of two reasons. Either the advertiser does not know what the mail order advertiser knows.
He is advertising blindly. Or he is deliberately sacrificing a percentage of his returns to gratify some desire.

There is some apology for that, just as there is for fine offices and buildings. Most of us can afford to do something for pride and
opinion. But let us know what we are doing. Let us know the cost of our pride. Then, if our advertising fails to bring the wanted returns,
let us go back to our model—a good mail order ad—and eliminate some of our waste.
