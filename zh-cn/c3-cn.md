# 第三章 提供服务

要牢记的是你所面对的人，和我们自己一样，大家都是自私的。他们对你的兴趣对你的利益毫不关心。他们想要的是服务。在做广告的人中间很多人会犯这个低级错误，犯错成本也很高。假如说广告上写，“就买我们的牌子把。把钱给别人还不如给我们。”很明显，这毫无诱惑力。

最好的广告从来不会让人买东西。这样做毫无用处。通常也不会提到价格，也不会告诉你哪个供应商有货。


广告完全是植入在服务里的。我们会说对于用户来说有哪些好处，为了能让用户下单，可能会提供一些样品，寄一些小样给客户，这样客户就可以不花一分钱，零风险的证实他们所说的好处。

有些广告看起来毫无私心，但他们都是基于对人性的理解设计出来的。设计人员深谙如何才能引导客户下单。

Some of these ads seem altruistic. But they are based on a knowledge of human nature. The writers know how people are led to buy.

Here again is salesmanship. The good salesman does not merely cry a name. He doesn't say, "Buy my article." He pictures the customer's
side of his service until the natural result is to buy.

A brush maker has some 2,000 canvassers who sell brushes from house to house. He is enormously successful in a line which would
seem very difficult. And it would be if his men asked the housewives to buy.

But they don't. They go to the door and say, "I was sent here to give you a brush. I have samples here and I want you to take your choice."

The housewife is all smiles and attention. In picking out one brush she sees several she wants. She is also anxious to reciprocate the gift.
So the salesman gets an order.

Another concern sells coffee, etc., by wagons in some 500 cities. The man drops in with a half-pound of coffee and says, "Accept this
package and try it. I'll come back in a few days to ask how you like it."

Even when he comes back he doesn't ask for an order. He explains that he wants to send the woman a fine kitchen utensil. It isn't free,
but if she likes the coffee he will credit five cents on each pound she buys until she has paid for the article. Always some service.

The maker of an electric sewing machine motor found advertising difficult. So, on good advice, he ceased soliciting a purchase. He offered to send to any home, through any dealer, a motor for one week's use. With it would come a man to show how to operate it."Let us help you for a week without cost or obligation," said the ad. Such an offer was resistless, and about nine in ten of the trials led to
sales.

So in many, many lines. Cigar makers send out boxes to anyone and say, "Smoke ten, then keep them or return them, as you wish."

Makers of books, typewriters, washing machines, kitchen cabinets, vacuum sweepers, etc., send out their products without any
prepayment. They say, "Use them a week, then do as you wish." Practically all merchandise sold by mail is sent subject to return.

These are all common principles of salesmanship. The most ignorant peddler applies them. Yet the salesman-in-print very often forgets them. He talks about his interests. He blazons a name, as though that
was of any importance. His phrase is "Drive people to the stores,"and that is his attitude in everything he says. People can be coaxed
but not driven. Whatever they do they do to please themselves. Many fewer mistakes would be made in advertising if these facts were
never forgotten.
