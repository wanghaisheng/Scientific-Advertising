# 第二章 推销术/销售


为了完全理解广告或者说了解它的基本原理，我们首先必须搞清概念。广告就是推销术/销售。它的原则就是推销的原则。这两个领域成功或是失败原因都是类似的。因此广告相关的问题都可以用销售员的标准来回答。

To properly understand advertising or to learn even its rudiments one must start with the right conception. Advertising is salesmanship. Its principles are the principles of salesmanship. Successes and failures in both lines are due to like causes. Thus every advertising question should be answered by the salesman's standards.


我们着重来阐述一下这一点。广告的唯一目的就是产生销售。根据实际产生的销售额可以判断到底是亏了还是赚了。

Let us emphasize that point. The only purpose of advertising is to make sales. It is profitable or unprofitable according to its actual
sales.

广告的目的不在于科普。不在于增加曝光。它主要也不是为了辅助其他销售人员。
It is not for general effect. It is not to keep your name before the people. It is not primarily to aid your other salesmen.


把广告看成一个销售人员就成了。Force it to justify itself.把广告和销售人员进行比较。计算成本和效果。好的销售人员不会找任何借口。这样就不会错的太离谱。


Treat it as a salesman. Force it to justify itself. Compare it with other salesmen. Figure its cost and result. Accept no excuses which good salesmen do not make. Then you will not go far wrong.


唯一的区别在于程度。广告是大众推销术。它可以一次向上千人推销，但销售员只能一对一推销。广告会有一个相应的成本。一些人一个普通的广告会花$10/每个字。因此每一个广告都可以是一个超级销售。

The difference is only in degree. Advertising is multiplied salesmanship. It may appeal to thousands while the salesman talks to
one. It involves a corresponding cost. Some people spend $10 per word on an average advertisement. Therefore every ad should be a
super-salesman.

一个销售人员的失误可能带来的损失只是一点点。一个广告的失误可能会造成1000倍的损失。因此要更加谨慎、准确。

A salesman's mistake may cost little. An advertising mistake may cost a thousand times as much. Be more cautious, more exacting,
therefore.

普通的销售可能影响的是你生意的一小部分。普通的广告会影响你所有的生意。

A mediocre salesman may affect a small part of your trade. Mediocre advertising affects all of your trade.


很多人都认为广告是广告文案的撰写。文学素养跟广告就如同演进术跟推销一样没有半毛钱关系。

Many think of advertising as ad-writing. Literary qualifications have no more to do with it than oratory has with salesmanship.

我们必须能清晰明了的表达我们的想法，就跟推销员必须具备的那样。但华丽的辞藻却是一大缺点，这点和独特的文风一样。都起到了喧宾夺主的效果，They reveal the hook.任意设计好的销售，如果太明显的话，都会带来相应的抵制。

One must be able to express himself briefly, clearly and convincingly, just as a salesman must. But fine writing is a distinct
disadvantage. So is unique literary style. They take attention from the subject. They reveal the hook. Any studied attempt to sell, if
apparent, creates corresponding resistance.


这点对人和广告都是同样的道理。好的演讲者很少会是好推销人员。他们会让顾客想太多。顾客会认为他们销售的商品卖点不是价值本身而是其他方面。

That is so in personal salesmanship as in salesmanship-in-print. Fine talkers are rarely good salesmen. They inspire buyers with the fear of over-influence. They create the suspicion that an effort is made to sell them on other lines than merit.

成功的推销人员也很少是好的演讲者。他们的话语不是那么优雅。他们都很朴实、真诚，非常了解自己的客户和产品。广告也是同理。

Successful salesmen are rarely good speech makers. They have few oratorical graces. They are plain and sincere men who know their
customers and know their lines. So it is in ad-writing.


很多广告行业的能人都是推销人员转型的。我们知道最好的推销人员总是挨家挨户的游说。也许他们并不了解语法，没有华丽的辞藻，但他们知道什么话任意让人信服。

Many of the ablest men in advertising are graduate salesmen. The best we know have been house-to-house canvassers. They may know
little of grammar, nothing of rhetoric, but they know how to use words that convince.

有一种简单直接的方式回答大多数广告相关的问题。只需要问自己，“这样做能不能帮推销人员卖货？”如果我当面碰到一个顾客这样做能不能帮我卖掉这些东西？”

There is one simple and right way to answer many advertising questions. Ask yourself, "Would this help a salesman sell the goods?" "Would it help me sell them if I met the buyer in person?"


给这类问题一个合理的答案能够避免无数失误。但如果你想炫耀，或者只是为了取悦对方，很大可能性最终顾客并不会为此买单。


A fair answer to those questions avoids countless mistakes. But when one tries to show off, or does things merely to please himself, he is
little likely to strike a chord which leads people to spend money


有些人喜欢喊口号，有些人喜欢玩概念。你会在推销时使用这些吗？你能想象顾客会对这些留下好印象吗？如果不是，那在网络销售中也不要使用。

Some argue for slogans, some like clever conceits. Would you use them in personal salesmanship? Can you imagine a customer whom
such things would impress? If not, don't rely on them for selling in print.


有些人会说，“要尽量简洁。人们很少会看内容。”你会这样跟推销员讲吗？当你站在他面前，要数着字数，跟他说话？简直无法想象。

Some say, "Be very brief. People will read but little." Would you say that to a salesman? With a prospect standing before him, would you
confine him to any certain number of words? That would be an unthinkable handicap.

广告也是同理。我们唯一的读者都是那些对我们商品感兴趣的。广告或长或短，都没有人看广告来取乐。就把它们想象成站在你面签，寻找信息。保证信息足以产生决策。

So in advertising. The only readers we get are people whom our subject interests. No one reads ads for amusement, long or short.
Consider them as prospects standing before you, seeking for information. Give them enough to get action.

有些人提倡超大字体和大标题。尽管他们认为推销人员大声讲话欠妥。只要是8-point 大小的字，人们会把感兴趣的都看完。报纸、杂志的印刷字大小都是这样的。人们已经习惯了。比这更大的话给人感觉就像高声大嗓的讲话。并不会获得额外有价值的关注。这样做未必会让人反感，但没有意义。这样做只会让你的成本翻倍。对大多数人来说这样子看起来很吵很露骨。

Some advocate large type and big headlines. Yet they do not admire salesmen who talk in loud voices. People read all they care to read in
8-point type. Our magazines and newspapers are printed in that type.Folks are accustomed to it. Anything larger is like loud conversation.
It gains no attention worth while. It may not be offensive, but it is useless and wasteful. It multiplies the cost of your story. And to
many it seems loud and blatant.

其他人则喜欢怪异的思路。他们希望每个广告都风格独特。你喜欢这样的推销人员吗？男人言行举止穿衣打扮正常些不是留下的印象会更好吗？

Others look for something queer and unusual. They want ads distinctive in style or illustration. Would you want that in a salesman? Do not men who act and dress in normal ways make a far better impression?


有些人喜欢考究的广告。在一定的程度内肯定是可以的，但这个其实不太重要。一些不太考究的广告，就跟不太注重着装的推销人员一样，反而是非常棒的推销人员。打扮的太花哨反而是一个缺点。

Some insist on dressy ads. That is all right to a certain degree, but it is quite unimportant. Some poorly dressed ads, like poorly dressed
men, prove to be excellent salesmen. Over-dress in either is a fault.


因此对于数不清的问题来说，用推销人员的标准来衡量它们，而不要用娱乐的标准。广告不是用来娱乐的。

So with countless questions. Measure them by salesmen's standards,not by amusement standards. Ads are not written to entertain. When
they do, those entertainment seekers are little likely to be the people whom you want.


这是那些最优秀广告的缺陷。广告制作人员忘了这一点。他们忘记了自己是推销员，做起了演员。他们想要的是掌声而不是销售额。

That is one of the greatest advertising faults. Ad-writers abandon their parts. They forget they are salesmen and try to be performers.
Instead of sales, they seek applause.


当你设计和准备一个广告时，想象你眼前有一个典型顾客。广告的主题、标题引起了他/她的关注。然后其他的内容也要按照如果你当面碰到顾客时的思路来处理。如果你是个正常人，一个不错的推销人员，那么你肯定能发挥出你最好的水平。

When you plan and prepare an advertisement, keep before you a typical buyer. Your subject, your headline has gained his or her
attention. Then in everything be guided by what you would do if you met the buyer face-to-face. If you are a normal man and a good
salesman you will then do your level best.

不要想象有很多人。这会给你一个模糊的印象。就想象有那么一位典型顾客，男人或女人，有很大可能想要购买你的商品。别想着逗乐。花钱是件很严肃的事情。别自吹自擂，大家都很讨厌这点。别想着炫耀。就按推销人员面前是一位half-sold person那样来做就好了。

Don't think of people in the mass. That gives you a blurred view.Think of a typical individual, man or woman, who is likely to want
what you sell. Don't try to be amusing. Money spending is a serious matter. Don't boast, for all people resent it. Don't try to show off. Do just what you think a good salesman should do with a half-sold person before him.

一些广告从业人员在做计划或写广告之前，会找人当面销售商品。最优秀的一些人会在一篇文章上花费数周时间，挨家挨户的推销。这样的方式他们了解到不同形式的话术和方法的反应。他们知道了潜在顾客想要什么，哪些点是无关紧要的。面谈数百个潜在顾客已经成为惯例。

Some advertising men go out in person and sell to people before they plan or write an ad. One of the ablest of them has spent weeks on one
article, selling from house to house. In this way they learn the reactions from different forms of argument and approach. They learn
what possible buyers want and the factors which don't appeal. It is quite customary to interview hundreds of possible customers.

一些人选择寄调查问卷给顾客来了解顾客的态度。不论是某种方式我们都要掌握到底该如何挥舞手中的剑。拍脑袋/猜测成本是很高的。

Others send out questionnaires to learn the attitude of buyers. In some way all must learn how to strike responsive chords. Guesswork
is very expensive.

广告文章的制作人员了解厂家，可能也了解经销商。但对于顾客来讲，这些知识会让他误入歧途，他感兴趣的并不是顾客感兴趣的。

The maker of an advertised article knows the manufacturing side and probably the dealer's side. But this very knowledge often leads him
astray in respect to consumers. His interests are not their interests.

广告制作人员研究顾客。尝试进入顾客的角色。他的成功主要取决于此而不是其他任何东西。

The advertising man studies the consumer. He tries to place himself in the position of the buyer. His success largely depends on doing
that to the exclusion of everything else.

就推销术而言，这本书其他章节都不如这一章重要。广告中绝大多数失败的原因在于向顾客推销他们并不想要的商品。但这一点恰恰是缺乏真正的推销术。

This book will contain no more important chapter than this one on salesmanship. The reason for most of the non-successes in advertising is trying to sell people what they do not want. But next to that comes the lack of true salesmanship.

人们用错误的观念来设计、制作广告。这些广告是取悦顾客的。顾客真实的需求被忽略了。如果是这样的态度，不论是当面还是网络，你都别想卖东西赚钱。

Ads are planned and written with some utterly wrong conception.They are written to please the seller. The interests of the buyer are
forgotten. One can never sell goods profitably, in person or in print, when that attitude exists.
