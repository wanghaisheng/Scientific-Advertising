# 第一章 广告法则是如何建立的 

广告在某些方面已经达到了科学的地步，这样的时代已经到来了。广告依据的是一些固定的原则，而且非常的精确。直到完全理解之前我们会对原因和效果进行分析。已经建立和证明了操作的正确方法。我们知道哪些最有效，根据基本法则行动。

The time has come when advertising has in some hands reached the status of a science. It is based on fixed principles and is reasonably
exact. The causes and effects have been analyzed until they are well understood. The correct methods of procedure have been proved and
established. We know what is most effective, and we act on basic laws.

广告一度被视为赌博，现在在一些方面已经是最安全的商业之一。可以确定的是没有其他存在如何多可能性的行业涉及的风险如此小。

Advertising, once a gamble, has thus become, under able direction,one of the safest of business ventures. Certainly no other enterprise
with comparable possibilities need involve so little risk.

因此本书讲的并不是理论和观点，而是成熟的原则和事实。本书是针对学生和广告从业人也的入门手册。每一句话都久经权衡。本书仅限于成熟的基础知识。如果要涉足任意未知的领域，我们都应该谨慎的对待。

Therefore this book deals, not with theories and opinions, but with well-proved principles and facts. It is written as a text book for
students and a safe guide for advertisers. Every statement has been weighed. The book is confined to established fundamentals. If we
enter any realms of uncertainty we shall carefully denote them.

广告目前所处的状态源自多个原因。很多全国性广告长久以来都是由大型的广告代理控制的。其中一些代理经过数百次活动的测试和比较了数千个方案和思路。结果都被观察和记录了下来，没有经验教训遗失掉。

The present status of advertising is due to many reasons. Much national advertising has long been handled by large organizations
known as advertising agencies. Some of these agencies, in their hundreds of campaigns, have tested and compared thousands of plans
and ideas. The results have been watched and recorded, so no lessons have been lost.

这些代理雇佣了大量的才俊。只有精明能干富有经验的才能满足全国性广告的要求。互相合作，彼此学习，从每个新的事业中学习，其中一些人就变成了大师。

Such agencies employ a high grade of talent. None but able and experienced men can meet the requirements in national advertising.
Working in co-operation, learning from each other and from each new undertaking, some of these men develop into masters.

个体可能会来了又走，但他们留下了记录和想法。这些就成为了一个公司的知识，所有人都必须遵循的手册。因此，在过去的几十年，这些代理公司变成了广告经验、成熟原则和方法的知识库。

Individuals may come and go, but they leave their records and ideas behind them. These become a part of the organization's equipment,
and a guide to all who follow. Thus, in the course of decades, such agencies become storehouses of advertising experiences, proved
principles, and methods.

大型代理公司也与行业内每个领域的专家紧密沟通。他们的客户通常主宰了需求。因此他们能了解到数不胜数的方法和策略的结果。于是就变成了商品推销相关内容的交换中心。业内几乎所有的销售问题都可以利用很多经验来准确回答。

The larger agencies also come into intimate contact with experts in every department of business. Their clients are usually dominating
concerns. So they see the results of countless methods and policies.They become a clearing house for everything pertaining to
merchandising. Nearly every selling question which arises in business is accurately answered by many experiences.


这样的状况持续的时间足够长，广告学和商品推销就变成了精确的科学。每一步都是算计好的。准确知识的作用导致每个目标都可以用最短的、最安全的和成本最低的方法实现。

Under these conditions, where they long exist, advertising and merchandising become exact sciences. Every course is charted. The
compass of accurate knowledge directs the shortest, safest, cheapest course to any destination.

我们学习到这些原则，重复性的进行试验验证它们。通过 keyed advertising ，跟踪最终结果，主要使用优惠券来实现。我们会将一种方法和其他方法进行横向纵向比较，并把结果记录下来。当某种方法总是结果最佳，我们就把这种方法定为一种固定原则。

We learn the principles and prove them by repeated tests. This is done through keyed advertising, by traced returns, largely by the use
of coupons. We compare one way with many others, backward and forward, and record the results. When one method invariably proves
best, that method becomes a fixed principle.

邮件订单广告要追溯到一分钱。cost per reply 每个回复的成本和 cost per dollar of sale 每单的销售成本要精确的记录。

Mail order advertising is traced down to the fraction of a penny. The cost per reply and cost per dollar of sale show up with utter
exactness.

一个广告会与其他广告进行比较，一种方法与另一种方法比较。标题、设置、大小、参数和图片都要互相比较。某种结果的成本即使降低一个百分点对于一些邮件订单广告页意义重大。因此不允许拍脑袋的情况出现，每个人必须知道哪种才是最佳的选择。因此邮件订单广告率先确立了我们绝大多数的基本法则。

One ad is compared with another, one method with another.Headlines, settings, sizes, arguments and pictures are compared. To
reduce the cost of results even one per cent means much in some mail order advertising. So no guesswork is permitted. One must
know what is best. Thus mail order advertising first established many of our basic laws.

当没有办法互相比较直接结果的时候，我们会把整个方案进行比较。方法的得分可能是通过这样的方式进行比较，利用销售成本来度量。

In lines where direct returns are impossible we compare one town with another. Scores of methods may be compared in this way,
measured by cost of sales.

但最常用的方法是使用优惠券，我们会提供一份样品、一本书、免费的一包或者其他东西来引诱直接的答复。因此我们掌握了每个广告所引发行为的数量。

But the most common way is by use of the coupon. We offer a sample, a book, a free package or something to induce direct replies.
Thus we learn the amount of action which each ad engenders.

但这些数字不是最终结论。某个广告可能会得到太多无效的答复，其他那些有价值的答复。因此我们最终的结论总是根据每个顾客的成本或者每美元成本的销售额( cost per dollar of sale)。

But those figures are not final. One ad may bring too many worthless replies, another replies that are valuable. So our final conclusions are always based on cost per customer or cost per dollar of sale.

我们会在“活动测试”的章节详细介绍这些优惠券方案中阐述。这里我们只解释我们如何利用他们来发现广告的原则。

These coupon plans are dealt with further in the chapter on "Test Campaigns." Here we explain only how we employ them to discover
advertising principles.

在大型广告代理公司，都会对数以百计的产品线中回收的优惠券持续观察和记录。单个产品线有时候会记录上千个独立广告的结果。因此我们会对广告的方方面面进行测试。我们通过大量结果的跟踪回答几乎每一个可能的答案。

In a large agency coupon returns are watched and recorded on hundreds of different lines. In a single line they are sometimes
recorded on thousands of separate ads. Thus we test everything pertaining to advertising. We answer nearly every possible question
by multitudinous traced returns.

通过这样的方式我们了解到一些仅适用于某些特殊产品的知识，但即使这样也能给类似的东西提供一些基本的原则。

Some things we learn in this way apply only to particular lines. But even those supply basic principles for analogous undertakings.

其他的一些则适用于所有产品。它们变成了通用广告的基础。它们是普适性的。没有一个广告从业人员会无视这些基础法则。

Others apply to all lines. They become fundamentals for advertising in general. They are universally applied. No wise advertiser will ever
depart from those unvarying laws.

我们在这本书里介绍这些基石，这些普适性的原则。只教授那些成熟的技术。和其他所有艺术、科学、机械学一样的，广告学中的技术。它们也是所有产品的基石。

We propose in this book to deal with those fundamentals, those universal principles. To teach only established technic. There is that
technic in advertising, as in all art, science and mechanics. And it is, as in all lines, a basic essential.

缺失这样的基础是广告学过去主要的难题。每个从业人员自己就是主宰。所有以往的经验知识，产品线中所有的进展，都只是他自己一个人的那本书。就跟一个人想要建一座现代化的机车却没有事先了解别人的成果。就跟哥伦布启航寻找新大陆一样。

The lack of those fundamentals has been the main trouble with advertising of the past. Each worker was a law to himself. All previous knowledge, all progress in the line, was a closed book to him. It was like a man trying to build a modern locomotive without first ascertaining what others had done. It was like a Columbus starting out to find an undiscovered land.


水手靠的是幻想和梦想，变换的微风，他们很少能够到达某个港口。偶尔碰到一个港口，也是经历了一段漫长的旅程。

Men were guided by whims and fancies—vagrant, changing breezes. They rarely arrived at their port. When they did—by accident—it
was by a long roundabout course.

早期航海员都会绘制自己的航线。没有地图来指引他们。没有灯塔标记港口，没有浮标显示礁石。沉船也没有被记录，因此无数的旅程都栽在同一块岩石和暗礁上。

Each early mariner in this sea mapped his own separate course.There were no charts to guide him. Not a lighthouse marked a
harbor, not a buoy showed a reef. The wrecks were unrecorded, so countless ventures came to grief on the same rocks and shoals.

这时候广告就是一种赌博——靠的是粗略的猜测。某个人猜中正确思路和其他人能猜中的可能性差不多。并不存在试验，因为很少有人会两次走同样的航线。

Advertising was then a gamble—a speculation of the rashest sort.One man's guess on the proper course was as likely to be as good as
another's. There were no safe pilots, because few sailed the same course twice.

这种状况已经被改善了。现在唯一的不确定性仅在于人和产品，而不是方法。很难量化个人的癖好、偏好和偏见，喜欢什么，不喜欢什么。我们很难讲一篇文章会受欢迎，但我们知道如何快速确认。我们知道如何以最有效的方法进行销售。

That condition has been corrected. Now the only uncertainties pertain to people and to products, not to methods. It is hard to
measure human idiosyncrasies, the preferences and prejudices, the likes and dislikes that exist. We cannot say that an article will be
popular, but we know how to find out very quickly. We do know how to sell it in the most effective way.

探险可能会失败，但失败本身并不是灾难。失败的教训是不能忽视的。 And the causes are factors which have nothing to do with the advertising.

Ventures may fail, but the failures are not disasters. Losses, when they occur, are but trifling. And the causes are factors which have
nothing to do with the advertising.

在这些新条件具备之后广告开始繁荣发展，在规模、声望和respect方面成倍增长，危险几乎被杜绝了。结果增加了许多倍。仅是从赌博变成了科学，从猜测变成了一门保守的生意。

Advertising has flourished under these new conditions. It has multiplied in volume, in prestige and respect. The perils have been
almost eliminated. The results have increased many fold. Just because the gamble has become a science, the speculation a very
conservative business.

大家应该都认可这些事实。This is no proper field for sophistry or theory, or for any other will-o'-the-wisp。外行指导外行是很荒谬的。在如此巨大可能性的行业是很可耻的，成功是偶然，巨大的成功是不可能存在的，除非是靠类似重力一样永恒的法则。

These facts should be recognized by all. This is no proper field for sophistry or theory, or for any other will-o'-the-wisp. The blind
leading the blind is ridiculous. It is pitiful in a field with such vast possibilities. Success is a rarity, maximum success an impossibility, unless one is guided by laws as immutable as the law of gravitation.

所以我们的主要目的是确定这些法则，告诉大家如何自己证实它们。在这些之外则是无穷的变化。没有两个广告活动是同等条件下进行的。个性化是很必要的。模仿是很耻辱的。但这些依赖独创性的变量在广告书本中没有地方来解释。这本书就是基础性介绍。

So our main purpose here is to set down those laws, and to tell you how to prove them for yourself. After them come a myriad
variations. No two advertising campaigns are ever conducted on lines that are identical. Individuality is an essential. Imitation is a
reproach. But those variable things which depend on ingenuity have no place in a text book on advertising. This is for ground-work only.

在有了更深的理解以后，我们期望能促进广告的发展。在业务中运用它们。将其作为能够取得最大成果的最安全最可靠的方式。

Our hope is to foster advertising through a better understanding. To place it on a business basis. To have it recognized as among the
safest, surest ventures which lead to large returns.

数以千计的成功案例展示了其可能性。它们的可变性展示出它们无限的潜力。即使很多需要的人仍然将最终的成功视为偶然。

Thousands of conspicuous successes show its possibilities. Their variety points out its almost unlimited scope. Yet thousands who
need it—who can never attain their deserts without it—still look upon its accomplishments as somewhat accidental.

以前是这样，现在已经不是了。我们期望这本书能够有助于了解这个领域。

That was so, but it is not so now. We hope that this book will throw some new lights on the subject.
