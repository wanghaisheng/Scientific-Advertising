# 第一章 广告法则是如何建立的 

广告在某些方面已经达到了科学的地步，这样的时代已经到来了。广告依据的是一些固定的原则，而且非常的精确。直到完全理解之前我们会对原因和效果进行分析。已经建立和证明了操作的正确方法。我们知道哪些最有效，根据基本法则行动。

The time has come when advertising has in some hands reached the status of a science. It is based on fixed principles and is reasonably
exact. The causes and effects have been analyzed until they are well understood. The correct methods of procedure have been proved and
established. We know what is most effective, and we act on basic laws.

广告一度被视为赌博，现在在一些方面已经是最安全的商业之一。可以确定的是没有其他存在如何多可能性的行业涉及的风险如此小。

Advertising, once a gamble, has thus become, under able direction,one of the safest of business ventures. Certainly no other enterprise
with comparable possibilities need involve so little risk.

因此本书讲的并不是理论和观点，而是成熟的原则和事实。本书是针对学生和广告从业人也的入门手册。每一句话都久经权衡。本书仅限于成熟的基础知识。如果要涉足任意未知的领域，我们都应该谨慎的对待。

Therefore this book deals, not with theories and opinions, but with well-proved principles and facts. It is written as a text book for
students and a safe guide for advertisers. Every statement has been weighed. The book is confined to established fundamentals. If we
enter any realms of uncertainty we shall carefully denote them.

广告目前所处的状态源自多个原因。很多全国性广告长久以来都是由大型的广告代理控制的。其中一些代理经过数百次活动的测试和比较了数千个方案和思路。结果都被观察和记录了下来，没有经验教训遗失掉。

The present status of advertising is due to many reasons. Much national advertising has long been handled by large organizations
known as advertising agencies. Some of these agencies, in their hundreds of campaigns, have tested and compared thousands of plans
and ideas. The results have been watched and recorded, so no lessons have been lost.

这些代理雇佣了大量的才俊。只有精明能干富有经验的才能满足全国性广告的要求。互相合作，彼此学习，从每个新的事业中学习，其中一些人就变成了大师。

Such agencies employ a high grade of talent. None but able and experienced men can meet the requirements in national advertising.
Working in co-operation, learning from each other and from each new undertaking, some of these men develop into masters.

个体可能会来了又走，但他们留下了记录和想法。这些就成为了一个公司的知识，所有人都必须遵循的手册。因此，在过去的几十年，这些代理公司变成了广告经验、成熟原则和方法的知识库。

Individuals may come and go, but they leave their records and ideas behind them. These become a part of the organization's equipment,
and a guide to all who follow. Thus, in the course of decades, such agencies become storehouses of advertising experiences, proved
principles, and methods.

大型代理公司也与行业内每个领域的专家紧密沟通。他们的客户通常主宰了需求。因此他们能了解到数不胜数的方法和策略的结果。于是就变成了商品推销相关内容的交换中心。业内几乎所有的销售问题都可以利用很多经验来准确回答。

The larger agencies also come into intimate contact with experts in every department of business. Their clients are usually dominating
concerns. So they see the results of countless methods and policies.They become a clearing house for everything pertaining to
merchandising. Nearly every selling question which arises in business is accurately answered by many experiences.


Under these conditions, where they long exist, advertising and merchandising become exact sciences. Every course is charted. The
compass of accurate knowledge directs the shortest, safest, cheapest course to any destination.

We learn the principles and prove them by repeated tests. This is done through keyed advertising, by traced returns, largely by the use
of coupons. We compare one way with many others, backward and forward, and record the results. When one method invariably proves
best, that method becomes a fixed principle.

Mail order advertising is traced down to the fraction of a penny. The cost per reply and cost per dollar of sale show up with utter
exactness.

One ad is compared with another, one method with another.Headlines, settings, sizes, arguments and pictures are compared. To
reduce the cost of results even one per cent means much in some mail order advertising. So no guesswork is permitted. One must
know what is best. Thus mail order advertising first established many of our basic laws.

In lines where direct returns are impossible we compare one town with another. Scores of methods may be compared in this way,
measured by cost of sales.

But the most common way is by use of the coupon. We offer a sample, a book, a free package or something to induce direct replies.
Thus we learn the amount of action which each ad engenders.

But those figures are not final. One ad may bring too many worthless replies, another replies that are valuable. So our final conclusions are
always based on cost per customer or cost per dollar of sale.

These coupon plans are dealt with further in the chapter on "Test Campaigns." Here we explain only how we employ them to discover
advertising principles.

In a large agency coupon returns are watched and recorded on hundreds of different lines. In a single line they are sometimes
recorded on thousands of separate ads. Thus we test everything pertaining to advertising. We answer nearly every possible question
by multitudinous traced returns.

Some things we learn in this way apply only to particular lines. But even those supply basic principles for analogous undertakings.

Others apply to all lines. They become fundamentals for advertising in general. They are universally applied. No wise advertiser will ever
depart from those unvarying laws.

We propose in this book to deal with those fundamentals, those universal principles. To teach only established technic. There is that
technic in advertising, as in all art, science and mechanics. And it is, as in all lines, a basic essential.

The lack of those fundamentals has been the main trouble with advertising of the past. Each worker was a law to himself. All previous knowledge, all progress in the line, was a closed book to
him. It was like a man trying to build a modern locomotive without first ascertaining what others had done. It was like a Columbus starting out to find an undiscovered land.


Men were guided by whims and fancies—vagrant, changing breezes. They rarely arrived at their port. When they did—by accident—it
was by a long roundabout course.

Each early mariner in this sea mapped his own separate course.There were no charts to guide him. Not a lighthouse marked a
harbor, not a buoy showed a reef. The wrecks were unrecorded, so countless ventures came to grief on the same rocks and shoals.

Advertising was then a gamble—a speculation of the rashest sort.One man's guess on the proper course was as likely to be as good as
another's. There were no safe pilots, because few sailed the same course twice.

That condition has been corrected. Now the only uncertainties pertain to people and to products, not to methods. It is hard to
measure human idiosyncrasies, the preferences and prejudices, the likes and dislikes that exist. We cannot say that an article will be
popular, but we know how to find out very quickly. We do know how to sell it in the most effective way.

Ventures may fail, but the failures are not disasters. Losses, when they occur, are but trifling. And the causes are factors which have
nothing to do with the advertising.

Advertising has flourished under these new conditions. It has multiplied in volume, in prestige and respect. The perils have been
almost eliminated. The results have increased many fold. Just because the gamble has become a science, the speculation a very
conservative business.

These facts should be recognized by all. This is no proper field for sophistry or theory, or for any other will-o'-the-wisp. The blind
leading the blind is ridiculous. It is pitiful in a field with such vast possibilities. Success is a rarity, maximum success an impossibility,
unless one is guided by laws as immutable as the law of gravitation.

So our main purpose here is to set down those laws, and to tell you how to prove them for yourself. After them come a myriad
variations. No two advertising campaigns are ever conducted on lines that are identical. Individuality is an essential. Imitation is a
reproach. But those variable things which depend on ingenuity have no place in a text book on advertising. This is for ground-work only.

Our hope is to foster advertising through a better understanding. To place it on a business basis. To have it recognized as among the
safest, surest ventures which lead to large returns.

Thousands of conspicuous successes show its possibilities. Their variety points out its almost unlimited scope. Yet thousands who
need it—who can never attain their deserts without it—still look upon its accomplishments as somewhat accidental.

That was so, but it is not so now. We hope that this book will throw some new lights on the subject.
